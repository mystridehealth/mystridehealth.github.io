      <h1>Mystride Health Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.</p>
      <h2>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM THE PEOPLE THAT VISIT OUR BLOG, WEBSITE OR APP?</h2>
      <p>When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, shoe sizing information or other details to help you with your experience.</p>
      <h2>WHEN DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION?</h2>
      <p>We collect information from you when you register on our site, place an order, enter a contest or sweepstakes, respond to a survey or communication such as email, fill out a form or enter information on our site or within our app.</p>
      <h2>HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
      <p>We may use the information we collect from you when you register, purchase products, enter a contest or promotion, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide the best analysis, advice and feedback through our algorithms.</li>
        <li>To personalize your user experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offering in which you are most interested.</li>
        <li>To allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service requests.</li>
        <li>To quickly process your transactions.</li>
        <li>To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature.</li>
        <li>If you have opted-in to receive our email newsletter, we may send you periodic emails. If you would no longer like to receive promotional emails from us, please refer to the “How can you opt-out, remove or modify information you have provided to us?” section below. If you have not opted-in to receive email newsletters, you will not receive these emails. Visitors who register or participate in other site features such as marketing programs and ‘members-only’ content will be given a choice whether they would like to be on our email list and receive email communication from us.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>HOW DO WE PROTECT VISITOR INFORMATION?</h2>
      <p>Our website is scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our site as safe as possible.</p>
      <p>We use regular Malware Scanning.</p>
      <p>Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</p>
      <p>We implement a variety of security measures when a user places an order, enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.</p>
      <p>All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.</p>
      <h2>DO WE USE 'COOKIES'?</h2>
      <p>We do not use cookies for tracking purposes.</p>
      <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (e.g. Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>
      <p>However, you can still place orders over the phone by contacting customer service.</p>
      <h2>HOW CAN YOU OPT-OUT, REMOVE OR MODIFY INFORMATION YOU HAVE PROVIDED TO US?</h2>
      <p>To modify your email subscriptions, please let us know by modifying your preferences in the “My Account” section. Please note that due to email production schedules you may receive any emails already in production.</p>
      <p>To delete all of your online account information from our database, sign into the “My Account” section of our site and remove your shipping addresses, billing addresses &amp; payment information. Please note that we may maintain information about an individual sales transaction in order to service that transaction and for record keeping.</p>
      <h2>THIRD PARTY DISCLOSURE</h2>
      <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.</p>
      <p>We use external service providers to store data on the cloud. These providers enable us to save data on servers physically maintained by them through the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model, where they do not have access to the data we store on their servers; it is only accessible through your login &amp; password as user, or through our administrative user &amp; password.</p>
      <p>However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
      <h2>THIRD PARTY LINKS</h2>
      <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These linked third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites (including if a specific link does not work).</p>
      <h2>GOOGLE</h2>
      <p>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users. https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en</p>
      <p>We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.</p>
      <h2>CALIFORNIA ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT</h2>
      <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/</p>
      <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users can visit our site anonymously.</li>
        <li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.</li>
        <li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</li>
        <li>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:
          <ul>
            <li>On User's Web Reports page</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Users are able to change their personal information:
          <ul>
            <li>By logging in to their account</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>HOW DOES OUR SITE HANDLE DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS?</h2>
      <p>We do not honor Do Not Track signals, because we currently do not track users by means of cookies or other methods of tracking. Consequently, we do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>
      <h2>DOES OUR SITE ALLOW THIRD PARTY BEHAVIORAL TRACKING?</h2>
      <p>We do not allow third party behavioral tracking.</p>
      <h2>COPPA (CHILDREN ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT)</h2>
      <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>
      <p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>
      <h2>FAIR INFORMATION PRACTICES</h2>
      <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
      <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>
      <p>We will notify the users via in-site notification within 7 business days</p>
      <p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
      <h2>CAN SPAM ACT</h2>
      <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
      <p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</li>
        <li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails after the original inquiry.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
        <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
        <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>
        <li>Monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
        <li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li>
        <li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at vince@mystridehealth.com and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.</p>
